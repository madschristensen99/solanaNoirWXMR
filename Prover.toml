# NOTE: The above values are EXAMPLES. In production:
# 1. Extract R, S, P from the Monero transaction using a Monero node
# 2. Parse the recipient address to get A and B
# 3. Compute H_s = H(r*A) using the transaction secret key
# 4. Compute the commitment using Pedersen hash
# 5. Use a library like @noble/ed25519 for Ed25519 operations
